This is a fork of the MMLU-Pro repo: https://github.com/TIGER-AI-Lab/MMLU-Pro

I've updated requirements.txt and made an install script, so that the code works with more recent module versions.

Run `install.sh` to create the venv and populate it with modules.

Use `run.sh` to run `evaluate_from_local.py` headless.
